# Spring Boot Migrated Application

This module contains a Spring Boot 3.x version of the original EJB based
Restaurant Ordering Management system. It provides the same domain model
and basic services using Spring Data JPA. Example REST endpoints are
provided for customers and managers.

Run the application with:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application uses an in-memory H2 database for simplicity.
